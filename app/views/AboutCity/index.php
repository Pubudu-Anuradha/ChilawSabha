                Tourists visit the well known Hindu temple located in Munneswaram, situated in the historic Demala Pattuva ("Tamil division") region of Puttalam District. The main festivals celebrated at the temple include Navarathri and Sivarathri.

During the festival, traders sell hand-painted clay models of animals such as deer, money box tills and 'raban' (traditional hand drums) from stalls all over the town.
